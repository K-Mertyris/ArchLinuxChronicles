# ArchLinuxChronicles
This repo will contain my journey in getting Arch Linux installed and working(?) maybe?



## The Goal

The goal is to install Arch Linux on a laptop and really learn the Linux OS by doing the work. I'll be looking up a **ton** of stuff and there will be many, many missteps along the way. The reason why I'm doing this is to expose myself to Linux and to get back into the 'building things' mindset - I have to accept that I'll make mistakes, it's alright to make mistakes, and I'll come out knowing more on the other end.

I'm planning on using the Arch laptop as a home file server at first, and then see what happens. 

## The How

Brute force. No, really, I'll be following guides that are out there as much as possible, and I'll provide links to the guides that I use as part of this chronicling process. I fully expect to reinstall Arch at least 10 times just to get my foundation underneath me and to also iterate on getting a setup that's "good enough" for what I'm looking to do.

The key acronym to pay attention to here is "MVP" - minimum viable product. What is the minimum amount of work I need to do to make it to the next step in the process or to make it to the next mini-goal? As stated above, this will likely cause me a lot of rework and a lot of headaches, but this is how I find that I learn best - by doing and by pulling only the information that I need at the time to get the job done. 

Documenting the journey will help me organize my thoughts, will help me in the future recall the experiences I had, and help me to create a playbook for installing Arch on other hardware.

## The Timeline

There really isn't a timeline for this journey, the journey is part of the goal. I will likely meander down some rabbit holes and skip others. I will keep my meandering information in separate .md files though, as I'll want to make my main .md research file solely about the setup of Arch first, then using Arch as a file server. 

## The Other Stuff

I'll also be learning how I like to use GitHub, learning more about Markdown, and other languages (scripting), and other tools. I'll try and find a good place for this information and I may kick that info out to another repo on my main GitHub page instead of having that info live as a nested folder or page in this repo. 

I've got a lot of figuring out to do, and this repo will likely get incredibly messy. If you're reading this, feel free to fork and pull whatever information suits your needs.
